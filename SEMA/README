 SEMAPHORE
------------

Semaphore is a synchronization technique.
semaphore is a special variable maintained inside kernel on which two operation can be performed.
Wait and Signal.
Before entering inside critical section[ protected part of code ] process checks the semaphore variable.
If it is zero process waits for the semaphore.
If it is Greater then ZERO it decrement the variable and enters into critical section.
Upon leaving the critical section process again Increment the semaphore variable while signalling all the 
waiting process to wake up fron the wait-queue.

----------------
| P1 | P2 | P3 | ------------------------------->P0
----------------	 			|
 Wait Queue					V
 			------------------------------------------------- Decrement the semaphore variable. if ( > 0)
			|						|
			|						|
			|	CRITICAL SECTION OF THE CODE		|
			|						|
			|						|
			-------------------------------------------------Increment the semaphore variable.(wake up the waiting process)

System calls:
------------
Semget() to get the semaphore identifier.
semctl() to control the semaphore operation.
semop()  to perform wait and signal operation.
